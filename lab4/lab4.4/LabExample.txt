Lab 4.4: The switch Statement

This lab lets students work with the switch statement.

Copy and paste the code below in a filename LastFirst_lab44.cpp (e.g. DoeJoe_lab44.cpp) and save it in Lab 4 folder.
Bring in the LastFirst_lab44.cpp program from the Lab 4 folder.
Remove the break statements from each of the cases. What is the effect on the execution of the program?
Add an additional switch statement that allows for a Passing option for a grade of D or better. Use the sample run given below to model your output.
Sample Run: What grade did you earn in Programming I ? A YOU PASSED! an A - excellent work!

Rewrite the program LastFirst_lab44.cpp using if and else if statements rather than a switch statement. Did you use a trailing else in your new version? If so, what did it correspond to in the original program with the switch statement?
Submit the revised LastFirst_lab44.cpp
The following is the code to be used:

 

 

// This program illustrates the use of the Switch statement.

// PLACE YOUR NAME HERE

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()

{

char grade;

cout << "What grade did you earn in Programming I ?" << endl;

cin >> grade;

switch( grade ) // This is where the switch statement begins

{

     case 'A': cout << "an A - excellent work !" << endl;

     break;

     case 'B': cout << "you got a B - good job" << endl;

     break;

     case 'C': cout << "earning a C is satisfactory" << endl;

     break;

     case 'D': cout << "while D is passing, there is a problem" << endl;

     break;            

     case 'F': cout << "you failed - better luck next time" << endl;       

     break;  

     default: cout << "You did not enter an A, B, C, D, or F" << endl;

}

return 0;
