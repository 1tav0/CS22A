Lab 4.2: if/else and Nested if Statements

This lab allows students to use variations of the if statement.

Copy and paste the code below in a filename LastFirst_lab42.cpp (e.g. DoeJoe_lab42.cpp) and save it in Lab 4 folder.
 Bring in the LastFirst_lab42.cpp program from the Lab 4 folder.
Run the program three times using 80, 55 and 60 for the average. What happens when you input 60 as the average? Modify the first if statement so that the program will also print "You Pass" if the average equals 60.
Modify the program so that it uses an if/else statement rather than two if statements.
Modify the revised program earlier to allow the following categories: Invalid data (data above 100), 'A' category (90-100), 'B' category (80-89), "You Pass" category (60-79), "You Fail" category (0-59). What will happen to your program if you enter a negative value such as -12?
Submit the revised LastFirst_lab42.cpp
The following is the code to be used:

// This program prints "You Pass" if a student's average is

// 60 or higher and prints "You Fail" otherwise

// PLACE YOUR NAME HERE

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()

{

float average; // holds the grade average

cout << "Input your average:" << endl;

cin >> average;

if (average > 60) cout << "You Pass" << endl;

if (average < 60) cout << "You Fail" << endl;

return 0;

}
