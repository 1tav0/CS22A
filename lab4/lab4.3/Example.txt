Lab 4.3: Logical Operators

This lab introduces the logical operators AND, OR, and NOT in a menu driven application program.

Copy and paste the code below in a filename LastFirst_lab43.cpp (e.g. DoeJoe_lab43.cpp) and save it in Lab 4 folder.
Bring in the LastFirst_lab43.cpp program from the Lab 3 folder.
How could you rewrite gpa >= 2.0 in the first if statement using the NOT operator?
Could you replace year !='4' in the else if statement with year < 4 or year <= 3? Why or why not?
If you replace
if ( gpa >= 2.0 && year == '4') with

if ( gpa >= 2.0 || year == '4') and replace

else if ( year != '4'|| gpa < 2.0) with

else if ( year != '4' && gpa < 2.0)

which students will graduate and which will not graduate according to this new program? Does this handle all cases (i.e., all combinations of year and gpa)?

Could you replace else if ( year != '4'|| gpa < 2.0) with the single word else?
this introduces a logic error!
fix the logic error, and then
submit the revised LastFirst_lab43.cpp
The following is the code to be used:

// This program illustrates the use of logical operators

// PLACE YOUR NAME HERE

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()

{

char year;

float gpa;

cout << "What year student are you ?" << endl;

cout << "Enter 1 (freshman), 2 (sophomore), 3 (junior), or 4 (senior)" << endl << endl;

cin >> year;

cout << "Now enter your GPA" << endl;

cin >> gpa;

if (gpa >= 2.0 && year == '4')

          cout << "It is time to graduate soon" << endl;

     else if (year != '4'|| gpa <2.0)

          cout << "You need more schooling" << endl;

return 0;

}
