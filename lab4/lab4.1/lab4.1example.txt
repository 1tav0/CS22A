Lab 4.1: Working with Relational Operators and the if Statement

This lab gives students their first practice with relational operators and the if statement.

Copy and paste the code below in a filename LastFirst_lab41.cpp (e.g. DoeJoe_lab41.cpp) and save it in Lab 4 folder.
Bring in the LastFirst_lab41.cpp program from the Lab 4 folder.
Run the program several times using a different input each time. Does the program do what you expect? Is so, explain what it is doing. If not, locate the error and fix it.
Modify the program so that the user inputs both values to be tested for equality. Make sure you have a prompt for each input. Test the program with pairs of values that are the same and that are different.
Modify the program so that when the numbers are the same it prints the following lines:
The values are the same. Hey that's a coincidence!

Modify the revised program earlier by replacing the two if statements with a single if/else statement. Run the program again to test the results.
Submit the revised LastFirst_lab41.cpp
// This program tests whether or not an initialized value

// is equal to a value input by the user

// PLACE YOUR NAME HERE

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main( )

{

int num1; // num1 is not initialized

int num2 = 5; // num2 has been initialized to 5

cout << "Please enter an integer" << endl;

cin >> num1;

cout << "num1 = " << num1 << " and num2 = " << num2 << endl;

if (num1 = num2)

     cout << "Hey, that's a coincidence!" << endl;

if (num1 != num2 ) cout << "The values are not the same" << endl;

return 0;

}
