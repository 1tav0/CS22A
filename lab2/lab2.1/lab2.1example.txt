Write your first and last name on one line.
Write your address on the next line (recall the function of the endl statement).
Write your city, state and zip on the next line.
Write your telephone number on the next line.
Remember that to output a literal, such as "Hello", you must use quotes.
Compile and run the program.

Copy and paste the code below in a filename LastFirst_lab21.cpp (e.g. DoeJoe_lab21.cpp) and save it in Lab 2 folder.
Bring in the LastFirst_lab21.cpp program from the Lab 2 folder.
