Fill in the code so that the program will produce the following:

 The circumference of the circle is 33.912 The area of the circle is 91.5624

Copy and paste the code below in a filename LastFirst_lab22.cpp (e.g. DoeJoe_lab22.cpp) and save it in Lab 2 folder.
Bring in the LastFirst_lab22.cpp program from the Lab 2 folder.
Compile and run the program.
Submit LastFirst_lab22.cpp by uploading it here.
The following is the code to be used:

// This program will output the circumference and area

// of the circle with a given radius.

// PLACE YOUR NAME HERE

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

const double PI = 3.14;

const double RADIUS = 5.4;

int main()

{

_________ area;      // definition of area of circle

 

float circumference; // definition of circumference

 

circumference = 2 * PI * RADIUS; // computes circumference

 

area =_____________; // computes area

 

// Fill in the code for the cout statement that will output (with description)

// the circumference

// Fill in the code for the cout statement that will output (with description)

// the area of the circle

 

return 0;
