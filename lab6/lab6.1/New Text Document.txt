Lab 6.1 Functions with void returns

Write a C++ program consisting of main plus two other functions which will do the following:

Take an integer input from the keyboard.

Send the integer to a function which will output the integer to the screen.

Send the integer to a second function which will tell the user that the integer is an odd value.

Do not tell the user anything if the integer is an even value.

Repeat this process until the user enters something which is not an integer; use input validation to check for validity.

 Any not valid input should terminate the program.
