Lab 5.1: Working with the while Loop

This lab begins with program which executes a basic echo print for character data.

Copy and paste the code below in a filename LastFirst_lab51a.cpp (e.g. DoeJoe_lab51a.cpp) and save it in Lab 5 folder.
The following is the code to be used:

// PLACE YOUR NAME HERE

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()

{

char letter = 'a';

 

while (letter != 'x')

{

     cout << "Please enter a letter" << endl;

     cin >> letter; cout << "The letter you entered is " << letter << endl;

}

return 0;

}

Copy the code below into your compiler.
This program is not user friendly. Run it a few times and see
Add to the code so that the program is more user friendly.
How would this code affect the execution of the program if the while loop is replaced by a do-while loop? Try it and see
The following is the code to be used for your lab:

// This program illustrates the use of a sentinel in a while loop.

// The user is asked for monthly rainfall totals until a sentinel

// value of -1 is entered. Then the total rainfall is displayed

// PLACE YOUR NAME HERE

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()

{

// Fill in the code to define and initialize to 1 the variable month

 

float total = 0, rain;

cout << "Enter the total rainfall for month " << month << endl;

cout << "Enter -1 when you are finished" << endl;

// Fill in the code to read in the value for rain

// Fill in the code to start a while loop that iterates

// while rain does not equal -1

// Fill in the code to update total by adding it to rain

// Fill in the code to increment month by one

 

cout << "Enter the total rainfall in inches for month " << month << endl;

cout << "Enter -1 when you are finished" << endl;

 

// Fill in the code to read in the value for rain  

 

if (month == 1)

     cout << "No data has been entered" << endl;

else

     cout << "The total rainfall for the " << month-1 << " months is "<< total << " inches." << endl;

return 0;

}

Complete the program above by filling in the code described in the statements in bold so that it will perform the indicated task.
Run the program several times with various input. Record your results. Are they correct? What happens if you enter -1 first? What happens if you enter only values of 0 for one or more months? Is there any numerical data that you should not enter?
What is the purpose of the following code in the program above?
