Lab 5.2: Working with the do-while Loop

This lab completes a program which is a menu driven application that uses a do-while loop and a switch statement.

Copy and paste the code below into your compiler
Fill in the indicated code described in the statements in bold to complete the below program. Then compile and run the program several times with various inputs. Try all the possible relevant cases and record your results.
What do you think will happen if you do not enter A, B, C, D or E? Try running the program and inputting another letter.
Replace the line
if (validBeverage == true) with the line if (validBeverage)

and run the program again. Are there any differences in the execution of the program? Why or why not?

The following is the code to be used:

// This program displays a hot beverage menu and prompts the user to

// make a selection. A switch statement determines which item the user

// has chosen. A do-while loop repeats until the user selects item E

// from the menu.

// PLACE YOUR NAME HERE

#include <iostream>

#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;

int main()

{

// Fill in the code to define an integer variable called number,

// a floating point variable called cost,

// and a character variable called beverage

bool validBeverage;

 

cout << fixed << showpoint << setprecision(2);

do {

     cout << endl << endl;

     cout << "Hot Beverage Menu" << endl << endl;

     cout << "A: Coffee $1.00" << endl;

     cout << "B: Tea $ .75" << endl;

     cout << "C: Hot Chocolate $1.25" << endl;

     cout << "D: Cappuccino $2.50" << endl << endl;

 

 

// Fill in the code to read in beverage

     switch(beverage)

     {

          case 'a': case 'A': case 'b': case 'B': case 'c': case 'C': case 'd': case 'D': validBeverage = true;

          break;

          default: validBeverage = false;

     }

     if (validBeverage == true)

          {

               cout << "How many cups would you like?" << endl;

// Fill in the code to read in number

          // Fill in the code to begin a switch statement

// that is controlled by beverage

     {

          case 'a': case 'A': cost = number * 1.0;

          cout << "The total cost is $ " << cost << endl;

          break;

// Fill in the code to give the case for tea ( $0.75 a cup)

// Fill in the code to give the case for hot chocolate ($1.25 a cup)

// Fill in the code to give the case for cappuccino ($2.50 a cup)

          case 'e': case 'E': cout << " Please come again" << endl;

          break;

          default:cout <<

// Fill in the code to write a message

// indicating an invalid selection.

                  cout << " Try again please" << endl;

     }

}

// Fill in the code to finish the do-while statement with the

// condition that beverage does not equal E or e.

// Fill in the appropriate return statement}
