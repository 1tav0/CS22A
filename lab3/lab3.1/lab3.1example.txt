Write a program that acts as a self-checkout register at a store and lets the user buy 2 items

The program will prompt the user and read in:
- the name of item 1. The name can be multiple words with space in between.
- the price of item 1 and number of items 1. Read both the price and the number in one C++ statement
- the name of item 2. The name can be multiple words with space in between.
- the price of item 2 and the number of items 2. Read both the price and the number in one C++ statement

Then the program calculates the total cost of the items, including the sales tax of 8.675%.
The tax should be defined as a constant in the program, and not used as a literal.

Last, the program prints the receipt on screen in the following format:

Item            Count   Price   Ext. Price

====            =====   =====   ========

Item 1 Name       Num   Price   Price * Num

Item 2 Name       Num   Price   Price * Num

Tax                             Tax * SubTotal

Total                           Total

The output should be in column format, and the prices are with 2 digits after the decimal point.
You can assume the item names will not be more than 20 characters wide.

Example program output:
(In this example the user buys mechanical pencils and binders, note that the item name is repeated in the second prompt of each item)

Enter the name of item 1:  mechanical pencil

Enter the number of mechanical pencil(s) and the price of each:  2  2.50

Enter the name of item 2:  binder

Enter the number of binder(s) and the price of each:  3  7.25

 

Item               Count   Price   Ext. Price

====               =====   =====   ========

mechanical pencil      2    2.50       5.00

binder                 3    7.25      21.75

Tax                                    2.31

Total                                 29.06
