Write a program that will do the following steps:
- generate 2 random integer numbers between 0 and 20
- calculate the square root of each number 
- calculate the average of the 2 numbers
- print the 2 random numbers
- print the square root of each random number with 3 digits after the decimal point
- print the average of the 2 numbers with 1 digit after the decimal point 

Example program output:
The two random numbers are 2 and 3

The average is 2.5

The square root of 2 is 1.214

The square root of 3 is 1.372
